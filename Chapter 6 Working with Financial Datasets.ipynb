It should also include a rolling strategy in order to patch together a single time series for a particular future from the individual fixed expiry futures.\n","\n","-Options Data: the presence of data for different strikes adds an\n","additional dimension to the data. In the case of options we have an entire surface for each historical date that we are analyzing.

Benefits: simplicity\n","Drawbacks: potential bias, in particular the dampening or heightening of volatility\n","\n","-Filling via Regression: lead to a better estimate based on what happened to other, correlated assets.\n","\n","The first step in doing this is identifying related assets that have a large history that includes data on the missing data points we are looking to fill.We could use a single market index, or we could rely on multiple related securities.\n","\n","To apply this method we simply need to estimate the β parameter, and the success of this method is largely dependent on the fit of regression. In cases where the explanatory power is low, this approach may lead to a dampening effect in volatility. Therefore, this method is most effective when there are longer gaps in our data and we are able to find a set of highly correlated assets.\n","\n","-Filling via Bootstrapping: bootstrapping is a non-parametric technique for creating sample paths from an empirical distribution. The idea behind bootstrapping is that each realization is in actuality just a draw from some unobserved density. Bootstrapping provides a method for sampling from that density with minimal assumptions.\n","\n","In practice bootstrapping involves simulating returns, and paths of asset prices by scrambling historical returns data, or sampling various historical returns and creating series of them in random order. In the context of missing data, bootstrapping enables us to create a synthetic dataset that is statistically equivalent to the dataset with missing data. We can then use the synthetic dataset instead.\n","\n","• Create a matrix of historical returns for the universe of assets.\n","• Generate a sequence of random integers between 1 and N, where N is the\n","number of historical days of data.\n","• Look up the return data for all assets that corresponds to that randomly chosen date.\n","• Apply these returns to the entire asset universe.\n","• Continue this for many time steps until the end of a path is reached.\n","\n","Each time this process is followed, a new bootstrapped path is created.When filling missing data however, we simply want to create a single path that is statistically equivalent, and as a result do not need to repeat the process. Instead we can take the path that results from the process above and substitute it for the period with missing data.\n","\n","The main benefit of bootstrapping is its non-parametric nature and its ability to preserve the market correlation structure and other properties.\n","\n","-Filling via K-Nearest Neighbor\n","\n","At a high level, the K-Nearest Neighbor works by locating the points that are the most similar to the point it is trying to estimate. It then uses an average of those closest points, or nearest neighbors, in order to make a prediction. In the case of k = 1 simply finds the closest point and predicts that the value will be equal to what it was at this point. In the case of k > 1, the closest k points will be found, and an average of their values will be used as the prediction.\n","\n","For example, in the context of filling in missing data, if we are trying to estimate the most likely the return of a given commodity, say Oil, and we are trying to do so using only the broader commodity index BCOM, then the KNN algorithm would proceed by finding the k closest returns to the current BCOM index return, and averaging the return of Oil over those k periods. The average of these k returns would then be the estimate we would use to fill in our missing data for that point."],"metadata":{"id":"mnyS5x02K610"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Outlier Detection\n","\n","-Single vs. Multi-Variate Outlier Detection: looking for return that appeared suspicious\n","\n","-Plotting\n","\n","-Standard Deviation: examine the data beyond a certain standard deviation threshold.
